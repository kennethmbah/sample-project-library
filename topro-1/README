The "topro" project (short for "topic proposer", sorry I wasn't very inspired on this) is a test that I made to play around with AngularJS. In the opposite to a lot of the AngularJS examples on the net, the project implements the entire chain: AngualarJS on the browser side, 
REST to communicate with the application server, JAX-RS/Jersey as server-side REST implementation, JSP as templating system of the server-side front-end, Java EE 6 for server-side back-end. 

The project demonstrates many different things, see Project home page: https://imifos.github.io/sample-project-library/

Uses: Bootstrap, jQuery and AngularJS
